Auto Detect Language

In this project, we have attempted to create a model for learning languages from the text.
We have used n-grams method for text classification with value of n from 1 to 5. 

The model can detect 7 languages: English, Chinese, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, French 
The data has been taken as text files from different Wikipedia articles in all these languages. 
Training data is in 'data\train' directory and test data is in 'data\test' directory.

To run the model, clone do the following:

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Go to the project directory
  3. Open terminal/command prompt
  4. Use command "python main.py"
